"""
The following forms are compatible with any subclass of AbstractBaseUser:

AuthenticationForm: Uses the username field specified by USERNAME_FIELD.
SetPasswordForm
PasswordChangeForm
AdminPasswordChangeForm
The following forms make assumptions about the user model and can be used as-is if those assumptions are met:

PasswordResetForm: Assumes that the user model has a field that stores the userâ€™s email address with the name returned by get_email_field_name() (email by default) that can be used to identify the user and a boolean field named is_active to prevent password resets for inactive users.
Finally, the following forms are tied to User and need to be rewritten or extended to work with a custom user model:

UserCreationForm
UserChangeForm
